## Requirements

In order to build libpmemstream, you need to have installed:

* **Linux 64-bit** (OSX and Windows are not yet supported), with at least:
    * C compiler (e.g. `gcc`)
    * [CMake](https://cmake.org/) >= 3.16
* **libpmem2**, which is part of [PMDK](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk) - Persistent Memory Development Kit 1.10
* Used only for **testing**:
	* C++ compiler (e.g. `g++`)
	* [**valgrind**](https://github.com/pmem/valgrind) - tool for profiling and memory leak detection. *pmem* forked version with *pmemcheck*
		tool is recommended, but upstream/original [valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) is also compatible (package valgrind-devel is required).
	* [**rapidcheck**](https://github.com/emil-e/rapidcheck) - some tests require this property based testing framework
	* **gdb**
* Used only for **development**:
	* [**pandoc**](https://pandoc.org/) - markup converter to generate man pages
	* [**perl**](https://www.perl.org/) - for whitespace checker script
	* [**clang format**](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) - to format and check coding style, version **9.0** is required

Required packages (or their names) for some OSes may differ. Some examples or scripts in
this repository may require additional dependencies, but should not interrupt the build.

See our **[Dockerfiles](utils/docker/images)** (used e.g. on our CI system)
to get an idea what packages are required to build the entire pmemstream,
with all tests, checks, and examples.

## Build and run tests

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pmem/pmemstream
cd pmemstream
mkdir ./build
cd ./build
cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug    # run CMake, prepare Debug version
make -j$(nproc)                 # build everything
make test                       # run all tests
```

To see the output of failed tests, instead of the last command (`make test`) you can run:

```sh
ctest --output-on-failure
```

## Install

To package `pmemstream` as a shared library and install on your system:

```sh
cmake .. [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release]	# prepare e.g. Release version
sudo make install			# install shared library to the default location: /usr/local
sudo make uninstall			# remove shared library and headers
```

To install this library into other locations, pass appropriate value to cmake
using `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable like this:

```sh
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release]
sudo make install		# install to path specified by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
sudo make uninstall		# remove shared library and headers from path specified by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
```

## Build packages

```sh
...
cmake .. -DCPACK_GENERATOR="$GEN" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release]
make -j$(nproc) package
```

where $GEN is a type of package generator and can be: RPM or DEB.

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX must be set to a destination where packages will be installed.

## Out-of-source builds

If the standard build does not suit your needs, create your own
out-of-source build and run tests like this:

```sh
cd ~
mkdir mybuild
cd mybuild
cmake ~/pmemstream  # this directory should contain the source code of pmemstream
make -j$(nproc)
make test           # or 'ctest --output-on-failure'
```
