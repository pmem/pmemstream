	* Version 0.2.0-rc1

	This is the second (still minor) release of pmemstream project.
	It contains many functional updates, API changes, and refactors,
	along with new tests and examples.

	New features:
	- Asynchronous API using libminiasync (https://github.com/pmem/miniasync)
		for concurrently appending data to the stream (currently, only one thread can append
		to a single region). It includes new functions for appending and publishing data;
		exposing 2 stages of an append - committed and persisted with 2 functions
		`pmemstream_async_wait_*(timestamp)` to wait for the given entry to be available
		for reading and/or for persistency guarantee.
	- Changed region and entry iterators API. It now provides `seek_first`, `next`, and `is_valid`
		functions for both types of iterators. It allows better flexibility.
	- Multiple regions. A simple region allocator, allowing creation of multiple regions;
		for now, only supports a single region size (within a given stream).
	- Timestamps for each entry to provide global entries' order (and easier recovery).
	- Exposed `pmemstream_region_usable_size` function to read the currently available size
		in given region; it can be used with combination of "entire region size"
		(`pmemstream_region_size`) to, e.g., calculate used region's space.
	- Full documentation of public API in the form of manpages.

	Other changes:
	- Add simple "append" benchmark
	- Enable integrity, consistency, and sanitizers tests
	- Add 4 more examples
