	* Version 0.2.1-rc1

	This is, most likely, the last patch release of pmemstream project.
	It contains multiple fixes, documentation updates, refactors, minor
	CI/examples/CMake changes, along with new and updated tests.
	The most relevant updates are listed below:

	- Add shadow value to pmemstream_persisted_timestamp
	- Fix and prune fences in atomic span ops
	- Fix races (e.g., in region.c) and issues reported by TSAN
	- Fix append benchmark for concurrent ops
	- Extend entry_iterator_is_valid with additional check
	- Enable prefault at open/create time
	- tests: extend multiple existing tests and add missing TCs
	- tests: add check for recovery during recovery (a corner case for torn recovery process)
	- Extend CMake with new options (e.g., for Thread Sanitizer and increased fortification level)
	- Update manpages with detailed descriptions

	* Version 0.2.0

	This is the second (still minor) release of pmemstream project.
	It contains many functional updates, API changes, and refactors,
	along with new tests and examples.

	New features:
	- Asynchronous API, which uses libminiasync (https://github.com/pmem/miniasync)
		for concurrently appending data to the stream; currently, multiple threads can append
		data concurrently to different regions, but no two threads can append to the same one.
		It includes new functions for appending and publishing data;
		exposing 2 stages of an append - committed and persisted with 2 functions
		`pmemstream_async_wait_*(timestamp)` to wait for the given entry to be available
		for reading and/or for persistency guarantee.
	- Changed region and entry iterators API. It now provides `seek_first`, `next`, and `is_valid`
		functions for both types of iterators. It offers higher flexibility.
	- Multiple regions. A simple region allocator, allowing creation of multiple regions;
		for now, only supports a single region size (within a given stream).
	- Timestamps for each entry to provide global entries' order (and easier recovery).
	- Exposed `pmemstream_region_usable_size` function to read the currently available size
		in a given region; it can be used with the combination of "entire region size" function
		(`pmemstream_region_size`) to, e.g., calculate the already used region's space.
	- Full documentation of public API in the form of manpages.

	Other changes:
	- Rename `pmemstream_entry_length` to `pmemstream_entry_size` for consistent naming convention
	- Add simple "append" benchmark
	- Enable integrity, consistency, and sanitizers tests
	- Add 4 more examples
